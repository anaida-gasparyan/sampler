# Sample streamed data

## Description

Receives and processes an input stream consisting of single characters.
The stream is of unknown and possibly very large length and the program should work regardless of the size of the input. The program is taking the sample size as a parameter and generate a random representative sample using that many characters.

As for receiving the data the tool should work with two kinds of inputs:
- values piped directly into the process using
```
cat input.txt | stream-sampler 5
```
- values generated by using a random source from within the language
```
dd if=/dev/urandom count=100 bs=1MB | base64 | stream-sampler 5
```

## Build
```
mvnw clean package
```
Application can be build with maven and jar will be available under `target\stream-sampler-1.0-SNAPSHOT-executable.jar`


## Run
And then application can be simply started using `java -jar`. 
Example:
```
cat input.txt | java -jar target/stream-sampler-1.0-SNAPSHOT-executable.jar 8
```
